# What is this project?

This project is a **personal** project that has been made during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. It has been made to analyse data from the start of the pandemic in France. The CSV file used throughout the project has been made by Lior Perez. There are different notebooks that analyse different data, such as the number of infected per region or the average age of deceased patients. All the data comes from the same CSV file and has been made using python, pandas, and the jupyter lab IDE.

# The notebooks

Below is a list and description of the different notebooks that have been made for the project:

- Infected per regions: This notebook calculates the total number of cases per region and displays them in a graph

- Average age of deceased patients: This notebook calculates the average age of the deceased patients, but also the average age of all th e COVID-19 cases. 

# Notes

There are also some HTML and PDF files in the repo. Those are made so that it is easier for non-programmers to access the project and the different notebooks.
